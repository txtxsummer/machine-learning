## Introduction
 - Discover the underlying structure of the data
	 - Unsupervised task, not predicting anything specific
<br/><br/>
 - What sub-populations exist in the data?
	 - How many are there?
	 - What are their sizes?
	 - Do elements in a sub-population have any common properties?
	 - Are sub-populations cohesive? Can they be further split up?
	 - Are they outliers?
## Types of Clustering Methods
- Goal
	- Monothetic: cluster members have some common property
		- E.g. all are males aged 20-35, or all have X% response to test B
		-
